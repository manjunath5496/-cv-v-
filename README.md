<p>Opening up the splendor of the immense heavens for the first time to serious&nbsp;<strong>scientific investigation</strong>. On the short time scale of our lives, not surprisingly, we underwent many transformations in our slow, painful evolution, an evolution often overshadowed by religious&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>dogma</strong></a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstition" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;superstition</a>&nbsp;to seek the answer to the question from the beginnings of our understanding. No progress was made in any scientific explanations because the experimental data were non-existent and there were no theoretical foundations that could be applied. In the latter half of the 20th century, there were several attempts such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>quantum mechanics</strong></a>&nbsp;(the theory of&nbsp;<strong>subatomic&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>physics</strong></a>&nbsp;and is one of the most successful theories of all time which is based on three principles: (1) energy is found in discrete packets called&nbsp;<strong>quanta</strong>; (2) matter is based on point particles but the probability of finding them is given by a wave, which obeys the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Schr&ouml;dinger wave equation</strong></a>; (3) a measurement is necessary to collapse the wave and determine the final state of an object), the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">big bang</a>," probability theory, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>general relativity</strong></a>&nbsp;(a theoretical framework of geometry which has been verified experimentally to better than 99.7 percent accuracy and predicts that the curvature of space-time gives the illusion that there is a force of attraction called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gravity</a>) to adjust to ensure agreement with experimental measurements and answer the questions that have so long occupied the mind of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">philosopher</a>s (from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Aristotle</strong></a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kant</a>) and scientists. However, we must admit that there is ignorance on some issues, for example, "<strong>we don't have a complete theory of universe which could form a framework for stitching these insights together into a seamless whole &ndash; capable of describing all phenomena&hellip;. We are not sure exactly how universe happened.</strong>" However, the generally accepted history of the universe, according to what is so-called the big bang theory (proposed by a Belgian priest,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Georges Lema&icirc;tre</strong></a>, who learned of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Einstein</a>'s theory and was fascinated by the idea that the theory logically led to a universe that was expanding and therefore had a beginning) has completely changed the discussion of the origin of the universe from almost pure speculation to an observational subject. In such model one finds that our universe started with an explosion.</p>
<p>This was not any&nbsp;<strong>ordinary explosion</strong>&nbsp;as might occur today, which would have a point of origin (center) and would spread out from that point. The explosion occurred simultaneously everywhere, filling all space with infinite&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">heat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>energy</strong></a>. At this&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">time</a>, order and structure were just beginning to emerge &minus; the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">universe</a>&nbsp;was hotter and denser than anything we can imagine (at such temperatures and densities (of about a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion (1 with 72 zeros after it) tons per cubic inch)&nbsp;<strong>gravity and quantum mechanics</strong>&nbsp;were no longer treated as two separate entities as they were in point-particle&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">quantum field theory</a>, the four known&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">force</a>s were unified as one unified super force) and was very rapidly expanding much faster than the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">speed of light</a>&nbsp;(this did not violate&nbsp;<strong>Einstein's dictum</strong>&nbsp;that nothing can travel faster than&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>light</strong></a>, because it was&nbsp;<strong>empty&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>space</strong></a>&nbsp;that was expanding) and cooling in a way consistent with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Einstein field equations</a>. As the universe was expanding, the temperature was decreasing. Since the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>temperature</strong></a>&nbsp;was decreasing, the universe was cooling and its curvature energy was converted into matter like a formless water vapor freezes into snowflakes whose unique patterns arise from a combination of symmetry and randomness. Approximately&nbsp;<strong>10 to the power of &minus;37 seconds into the expansion</strong>, a phase transition caused a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cosmic inflation</a>, during which the universe underwent an incredible amount of superliminal expansion and grew exponentially by a factor&nbsp;<strong>e to the power of 3Ht&nbsp;</strong>(where H was a constant called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Hubble parameter</strong>&nbsp;</a>and t was the time) &ndash; just as the prices grew by a factor of ten million in a period of 18 months in Germany after the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">First World War</a>&nbsp;and it doubled in size every tiny fraction of a second &ndash; just as prices double every year in certain countries. After inflation stopped, the universe was not in a&nbsp;<strong>de Sitter phase</strong>&nbsp;and its rate of expansion was no longer proportional to its volume since H was no longer constant. At that time, the entire universe had grown by an unimaginable factor of 10 to the power of 50 and consisted of a hot&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">plasma</a>&nbsp;"soup" of high energetic&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">quark</a>s as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>lepton</strong></a>s (a group of particles which interacted with each other by exchanging new particles called the W and Z<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;boson</a>s as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">photon</a>s). There were a number of different varieties of quarks: there were six "<strong>flavors</strong>," which we now call&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_quark" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>up</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_quark" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">down</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_quark" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">strange</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charm_quark" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">charmed</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_quark" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">bottom</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">top</a>. And among the leptons the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">electron</a>&nbsp;was a stable object and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>muon</strong></a>&nbsp;(that had mass 207 times larger than electron and now belongs to the second redundant generation of particles found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Standard Model</a>) and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_(particle)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>tauon</strong></a>&nbsp;(that had mass 3,490 times the mass of the electron) were allowed to decay into other particles. And associated to each charged lepton, there were three distinct kinds of ghostly particles called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>neutrino</strong></a>s (the most mysterious of subatomic particles, are difficult to detect because they rarely interact with other forms of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">matter</a>. Although they can easily pass through a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">planet</a>&nbsp;or solid walls, they seldom leave a trace of their existence. Evidence of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">neutrino oscillation</a>s prove that neutrinos are not&nbsp;<strong>massless</strong>&nbsp;but instead have a mass less than one-hundred-thousandth that of an electron):</p>
<ul>
<li>the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_neutrino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>electron neutrino</strong></a>&nbsp;(which was predicted in the early 1930s by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wolfgang Pauli</a>&nbsp;and discovered by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Reines" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Frederick Reines</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Cowan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Clyde Cowan</a>&nbsp;in mid-1950s)</li>
<li>the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon_neutrino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>muon neutrino</strong></a>&nbsp;(which was discovered by physicists when studying the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cosmic ray</a>s in late 1930s)</li>
<li>the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_neutrino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>tauon neutrino</strong></a>&nbsp;(a heavier cousin of the electron neutrino)</li>
</ul>
<p>Temperatures were so high that these quarks and leptons were moving around so fast that they escaped any attraction toward each other due to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">nuclear</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>electromagnetic forces</strong>. However, they possessed so much energy that whenever they collided, particle &ndash; antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">collision</a>s. And the uncertainty in the position of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">particle</a>&nbsp;times the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">uncertainty</a>&nbsp;in its&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>velocity</strong></a>&nbsp;times the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mass</a>of the particle was never smaller than a certain quantity, which was known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Planck's constant</strong></a>. Similarly, &Delta;E &times; &Delta;t was &le; h/4&pi; (where h was a quantity called&nbsp;<strong>Planck's constant&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">&pi;</a>&nbsp;= 3.14159 . . . was the familiar ratio of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">circumference</a>&nbsp;of a circle to its diameter). Hence the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Heisenberg's uncertainty principle</strong></a>&nbsp;(which captures the heart of quantum mechanics &ndash; i.e. features normally thought of as being so basic as to be beyond question (e.g. that objects have definite&nbsp;<strong>position</strong>s and speeds and that they have definite energies at definite moments) are now seen as mere artifacts of Planck's constant being so tiny on the scales of the everyday world) was a fundamental, inescapable property of the universe. At some point an unknown reaction led to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over&nbsp;<strong>antiquarks</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>antileptons</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; of the order of one part in 30&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">million</a>. This resulted in the predominance of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">matter</a>&nbsp;over&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>antimatter</strong></a>&nbsp;in the universe.</p>
<p>The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreased in inverse proportion to the size of the universe (since the average energy &ndash; or speed &ndash; of the particles was simply a measure of the temperature of the universe). The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">symmetry</a>&nbsp;(a central part of the theory [and] its experimental confirmation would be a compelling, albeit circumstantial, piece of evidence for strings) however, was unstable and, as the universe cooled, a process called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">spontaneous symmetry breaking</a>&nbsp;phase transitions placed the&nbsp;<strong>fundamental forces of physics</strong>&nbsp;and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form. After about 10 to the power of &minus;11 seconds, the picture became less speculative, since particle energies dropped to values that can be attained in particle physics experiments.</p>
<p>At about 10 to the power of &minus;6 seconds, there was a continuous exchange of the smallest constituents of the strong force called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>gluon</strong></a>s between the quarks and this resulted in a force that pulled the quarks to form little wisps of matter which obeyed the strong interactions and made up only a tiny fraction of the matter in the universe and was dwarfed by dark matter called the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>baryon</strong></a>s (&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proton</a>s &ndash; a positively charged particles very similar to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">neutron</a>s, which accounts for roughly half the particles in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>nucleus</strong></a>&nbsp;of most atoms and are much more massive than electrons &minus;1,836 times more massive &minus; and neutrons &ndash; a neutral subatomic particles which, along with the protons, makes up the nuclei of atoms and are 1,838 times more massive than electrons &ndash; belonged to the class baryons) as well as other particles. The small excess of&nbsp;<strong>quarks over antiquarks</strong>&nbsp;led to a small excess of baryons over&nbsp;<strong>antibaryons</strong>. The proton was composed of two up quarks and one down quark and the neutron was composed of two down quarks and one up quark. And other particles contained other quarks (<strong>strange, charmed, bottom, and top</strong>), but these all had a much greater mass and decayed very rapidly into protons and neutrons. The charge on the up quark was = + 2/3 e and the charge on the down quark was = &ndash; 1/3 e. The other quarks possessed charges of + 2/3 e or &ndash; 1/3 e. The&nbsp;<strong>charges of the quarks</strong>&nbsp;added up in the combination that composed the proton but cancelled out in the combination that composed the neutron i.e.,</p>
<ul>
<li>Proton charge was = (2/3)e + (2/3)e + (&ndash;1/3)e = e</li>
<li>Neutron charge was = (2/3)e + (&ndash;1/3)e + (&ndash;1/3)e = 0</li>
</ul>
<p>And the force that confined the mass of the proton or the neutron (i.e., its constituent particles) to its radius was so strong that it is now proved very difficult if not impossible to obtain an isolated quark. As we try to pull them out of the proton or neutron it gets more and more difficult. Even stranger is the suggestion that the harder and harder if we could drag a quark out of a proton this&nbsp;<strong>force gets bigger and bigger</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; rather like the force in a spring as it is stretched causing the quark to snap back immediately to its original position. This property of confinement prevented one from observing an isolated quark (and the question of whether it makes sense to say quarks really exist if we can never isolate one was a controversial issue in the years after the quark model was first proposed). However, now it has been revealed that experiments with large&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>particle accelerator</strong></a>s indicate that at high energies the strong force becomes much weaker, and one can observe an isolated quark. In fact, the standard model (one of the most successful physical theories of all time and since it fails to account for gravity (and seems so ugly), theoretical&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">physicist</a>s feel it cannot be the final theory) in its current form requires that the quarks not be free. The observation of a free quark would falsify that aspect of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>standard model</strong></a>, although nicely confirm the quark idea itself and fits all the experimental data concerning particle physics without exception.&nbsp;<strong>Each quark possessed baryon number = 1/3:</strong>&nbsp;the total&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_number" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">baryon number</a>&nbsp;of the proton or the neutron was the sum of the baryon numbers of the quarks from which it was composed. And the electrons and neutrinos contained no quarks; they were themselves truly fundamental particles. And since there were no electrically charged particles lighter than an electron and a proton, the electrons and protons were prevented from decaying into lighter particles &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>photon</strong></a>s (that carried zero mass, zero&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">charge</a>, a definite energy "E" = pc and a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>momentum</strong></a>&nbsp;"p" = mc) and less&nbsp;<strong>massive neutrinos</strong>&nbsp;(with very little mass, no electric charge, and no radius &mdash; and, adding insult to injury, no strong force acted on it). And a free neutron being heavier than the proton was not prevented from decaying into a proton (<strong>plus an electron and an antineutrino</strong>). The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new&nbsp;<strong>proton&ndash;antiproton pairs</strong>, so a mass&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>annihilation</strong></a>&nbsp;immediately followed, leaving just one in 10 to the power of 10 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles (i.e., antiparticle was sort of the reverse of&nbsp;<strong>matter particle</strong>. The counterparts of electrons were positrons (positively charged), and the counterparts of protons were&nbsp;<strong>antiprotons</strong>&nbsp;(negatively charged). Even neutrons had an antiparticle:&nbsp;<strong>antineutrons</strong>). A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons (positron: the antiparticle of an electron with exactly the same mass as an&nbsp;<strong>electron but its electric charge</strong>is +1e). After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving&nbsp;<strong>relativistically</strong>&nbsp;and the energy density of the universe was dominated by photons &minus; (what are sometimes referred to as the&nbsp;<strong>messenger particles for the electromagnetic force</strong>) &minus; with a minor contribution from neutrinos. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>density</strong></a>&nbsp;of the universe was about 4 &times; 10 to the power of 9 times the density of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">water</a>&nbsp;and much hotter than the center of even the hottest star &ndash; no ordinary components of matter as we know them &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">molecule</a>s, atoms, nuclei &ndash; could hold together at this temperature. And the total&nbsp;<strong>positive charge due to protons</strong>&nbsp;plus the total negative charge due to electrons in the universe was = 0 (Just what it was if electromagnetism would not dominate over gravity and for the universe to remain electrically neutral).</p>
<p>And a few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million; 10 to the power of 9)&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kelvin</a>&nbsp;and the density was about that of&nbsp;<strong>air</strong>, protons and neutrons no longer had sufficient energy to escape the attraction of the strong nuclear force and they started to combine together to produce the universe's&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">deuterium</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">helium&nbsp;</a>nuclei in a process called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Big Bang nucleosynthesis</strong></a>. And most of the protons remained uncombined as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hydrogen</a>&nbsp;nuclei. And inside the tiny core of an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">atom</a>, consisting of protons and neutrons, which was roughly 10 to the power of &minus;13 cm across or roughly an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angstrom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">angstrom</a>, a proton was never permanently a proton and also a neutron was never permanently a neutron. They kept on changing into each other. A neutron emitted a &pi;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>meson</strong></a>&nbsp;(a particle predicted by the Japanese physicist&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Yukawa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Hideki Yukawa</strong></a>&nbsp;and observed in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cosmic ray</a>experiments (for which he was awarded the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Nobel Prize&nbsp;</a>in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">physics</a>&nbsp;in 1949) &ndash; composed of a quark and antiquark, which is unstable because the quark and antiquark can annihilate each other, producing electrons and other particles) and became proton and a proton absorbed a &pi; meson and became a neutron. That is, the exchange force resulted due to the absorption and emission of &pi; mesons kept the&nbsp;<strong>protons and neutrons</strong>&nbsp;bound in the nucleus. And the time in which the absorption and emission of &pi; mesons took place was so small that &pi; mesons were not detected. And a property of the strong force called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_freedom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">asymptotic freedom</a>&nbsp;caused it to become weaker at short distances. Hence, although quarks were bound in nuclei by the strong force, they moved within nuclei almost as if they felt no force at all.</p>
<p>Within only a few hours of the big bang, the&nbsp;<strong>Big Bang nucleosynthesis</strong>&nbsp;stopped. And after that, for the next million years or so, the universe just continued expanding, without anything much happening. Eventually, once the temperature had dropped to a few thousand degrees, there was a continuous exchange of&nbsp;<strong>virtual photons</strong>&nbsp;between the nuclei and the electrons. And the exchange was good enough to produce &mdash; what else? &mdash; A force (proportional to a quantity called their charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them). And that force pulled the electrons towards the nuclei to form neutral atoms (the basic unit of ordinary matter (Atom is from a Greek word meaning "<strong>unbreakable</strong>" because at the time atoms were first dealt with, it was thought they could not be broken up into smaller units), made up of a tiny nucleus (consisting of protons and neutrons) surrounded by orbiting electrons). And these atoms reflected, absorbed, and scattered light and the resulted light was red shifted by the expansion of the universe towards the&nbsp;<strong>microwave region of the</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>&nbsp;electromagnetic spectrum</strong></a>. And there was cosmic microwave background radiation (which, through the last 15 billion years of cosmic expansion, has now cooled to a mere handful of degrees above&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>absolute zero</strong></a>&nbsp;(&ndash;273&ordm;C &minus; the lowest possible temperature, at which substances contain no heat energy and all&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">vibration</a>s stop &mdash; almost: the water molecules are as fixed in their equilibrium positions as&nbsp;<strong>quantum uncertainty&nbsp;</strong>allows) and today, scientists measure tiny deviations within this background radiation to provide evidence for inflation or other theories). The irregularities in the universe meant that some regions of the nearly uniformly distributed atoms had slightly higher density than others. The gravitational attraction of the extra density slowed the expansion of the region, and eventually caused the region to collapse to form galaxies and stars. And the nuclear reactions in the stars transformed hydrogen to helium (composed of two protons and two neutrons, highly stable &mdash; as predicted by the rules of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">quantum mechanics</a>) to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">carbon</a>&nbsp;(with their self-bonding properties, provide the immense variety for the complex cellular machinery &mdash; no other&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">element</a>&nbsp;offers a comparable range of possibilities) with the release of an enormous amount of energy via Einstein's equation&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>E = mc squared</strong></a>. This was the energy that lighted up the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">star</a>s. And the process continued converting the carbon to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">oxygen</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">silicon</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">iron</a>. And the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reaction" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>nuclear reaction</strong></a>&nbsp;ceased at iron. And the star experienced several chemical changes in its innermost core and these changes required huge amount of energy which was supplied by the severe gravitational contraction. And as a result the central region of the star collapsed to form a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">neutron star</a>. And the outer region of the star got blown off in a tremendous explosion called a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">supernova</a>, which outshone an entire&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">galaxy&nbsp;</a>of 100 billion stars, spraying the manufactured elements into space. And these elements provided some of the raw material for the generation of cloud of rotating gas which went to form the&nbsp;<strong>sun and a small amount of the heavier elements&nbsp;</strong>collected together to form the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">asteroid</a>s, stars,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">comet</a>s, and the bodies that now orbit the sun as planets like the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Earth</a>&nbsp;and their presence caused the fabric of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">space</a>&nbsp;around them to warp (more massive the bodies, the greater the distortion it caused in the surrounding space).</p>
<p>The earth was initially very hot and without an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>atmosphere</strong></a>. In the course of time the planet earth produced&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>volcano</strong></a>es and the volcanoes emitted&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">water vapor</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">carbon dioxide</a>&nbsp;and other gases. And there was an atmosphere. This early atmosphere contained no&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">oxygen</a>, but a lot of other gases and among them some were poisonous, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>hydrogen sulfide</strong></a>&nbsp;(the gas that gives rotten eggs their smell). And the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sunlight</a>&nbsp;dissociated water vapor and there was oxygen. And carbon dioxide in excess heated the earth and balance was needed. So carbon dioxide dissolved to form&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_acid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>carbonic acid</strong></a>&nbsp;and carbonic acid on rocks produced&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">limestone</a>&nbsp;and subducted limestone fed volcanoes that released more carbon dioxide. And there was high temperature and high temperature meant more&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">evaporation</a>&nbsp;and dissolved more carbon dioxide. And as the carbon dioxide turned into limestone, the temperature began to fall. And a consequence of this was that most of the water vapor condensed and formed the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ocean</a>s. And the low temperature meant less evaporation and carbon dioxide began to build up in the atmosphere. And the cycle went on for billions of years. And after the few billion years, volcanoes ceased to exist. And the&nbsp;<strong>molten earth cooled</strong>, forming a hardened, outer crust. And the earth's atmosphere consisted of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, plus other miscellaneous gases (hydrogen sulfide,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">methane</a>, water vapor, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ammonia</a>). And then a continuous&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>electric current</strong></a>&nbsp;through the atmosphere simulated&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lightning</a>&nbsp;storms. And some of the gases came to be arranged in the form of more complex&nbsp;<strong>organic molecule</strong>s such as simple&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">amino acid</a>s (the basic chemical sub-unit of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">protein</a>s, when, when linked together, formed proteins) and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">carbohydrate</a>s (which were very simple sugars). And the water vapor in the atmosphere probably caused millions of seconds of&nbsp;<strong>torrential rains</strong>, during which the organic molecules reached the earth. And it took two and a half billion years for an ooze of organic molecules to react and built earliest cells as a result of chance combinations of atoms into large structures called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecule" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">macromolecule</a>s and then advance to a wide variety of one &ndash; celled&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">organism</a>s, and another billion years to evolve through a highly sophisticated form of life to primitive&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mammal</a>s endowed with two elements:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gene</a>s (a set of instructions that tell them how to sustain and multiply themselves), and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>metabolism</strong></a>&nbsp;(a mechanism to carry out the instructions). But then&nbsp;<strong>evolution</strong>&nbsp;seemed to have speeded up. It only took about a hundred million years to develop from the early mammals (the highest class of animals, including the ordinary hairy&nbsp;<strong>quadrupeds</strong>, the whales and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Mammoth</a>s , and characterized by the production of living young which are nourished after birth by milk from the teats (<strong>MAMMAE</strong>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MAMMARY GLAND</a>S) of the mother) to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens_(disambiguation)#Popular_culture" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Homosapiens</strong></a>. This picture of a universe that started off very hot and cooled as it expanded (like when things are compressed they heat up ... and, when things ... expand ... they cool down) is in agreement with all the observational evidence which we have today (and it explains&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Olbers' paradox</a>: The paradox that asks why the night sky is black. If the universe is infinite and uniform, then we must receive light from an infinite number of stars, and hence the sky must be white, which violates observation). Nevertheless, it leaves a number of important questions unanswered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why the universe started off very hot i.e., why it violently emerged from a state of infinite compression?</li>
<li>Why is the universe the same everywhere i.e., looks the same from every point (homogeneous) and looks the same in every direction (<strong>isotropic</strong>)? If the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cosmic inflation&nbsp;</a>made the universe flat,&nbsp;<strong>homogeneous and isotropic</strong>, then what is the hypothetical field that powered the inflation? What are the details of this inflation?</li>
<li>Much is explained by protons and electrons. But there remains the neutrino&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>&asymp;10 to the power of 9 neutrinos / proton. What is their physical picture in the universe?</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>big bang theory</strong>, on its own, cannot explain these features or answer these questions because of its prediction that the universe started off with infinite density at the&nbsp;<strong>big bang singularity</strong>. At the singularity (a state of infinite gravity), all the known physical laws of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>cosmology</strong></a>&nbsp;would break down: one couldn't predict what would come out of the infinitely dense Planck-sized nugget called the singularity.</p>
